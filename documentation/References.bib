@article{Fujimoto1990,
abstract = {Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES), sometimes called distributed simulation, refers to the execution of a single discrete event simulation program on a parallel computer. PDES has attracted a considerable amount of interest in recent years. From a pragmatic standpoint, this interest arises from the fact that large simulations in engineering, computer science, economics, and military applications, to mention a few, consume enormous amounts of time on sequential machines. From an academic point of view, parallel simulation is interesting because it represents a problem domain that often contains substantial amounts of parallelism (e.g., see [59]), yet paradoxically, is surprisingly difficult to parallelize in practice. A sufficiently general solution to the PDES problem may lead to new insights in parallel computation as a whole. Historically, the irregular, data-dependent nature of PDES programs has identified it as an application where vectorization techniques using supercomputer hardware provide little benefit [14].A discrete event simulation model assumes the system being simulated only changes state at discrete points in simulated time. The simulation model jumps from one state to another upon the occurrence of an event. For example, a simulator of a store-and-forward communication network might include state variables to indicate the length of message queues, the status of communication links (busy or idle), etc. Typical events might include arrival of a message at some node in the network, forwarding a message to another network node, component failures, etc.We are especially concerned with the simulation of asynchronous systems where events are not synchronized by a global clock, but rather, occur at irregular time intervals. For these systems, few simulator events occur at any single point in simulated time; therefore parallelization techniques based on lock-step execution using a global simulation clock perform poorly or require assumptions in the timing model that may compromise the fidelity of the simulation. Concurrent execution of events at different points in simulated time is required, but as we shall soon see, this introduces interesting synchronization problems that are at the heart of the PDES problem.This article deals with the execution of a simulation program on a parallel computer by decomposing the simulation application into a set of concurrently executing processes. For completeness, we conclude this section by mentioning other approaches to exploiting parallelism in simulation problems.Comfort and Shepard et al. have proposed using dedicated functional units to implement specific sequential simulation functions, (e.g., event list manipulation and random number generation [20, 23, 47]). This method can provide only a limited amount of speedup, however. Zhang, Zeigler, and Concepcion use the hierarchical decomposition of the simulation model to allow an event consisting of several subevents to be processed concurrently [21, 98]. A third alternative is to execute independent, sequential simulation programs on different processors [11, 39]. This replicated trials approach is useful if the simulation is largely stochastic and one is performing long simulation runs to reduce variance, or if one is attempting to simulate a specific simulation problem across a large number of different parameter settings. However, one drawback with this approach is that each processor must contain sufficient memory to hold the entire simulation. Furthermore, this approach is less suitable in a design environment where results of one experiment are used to determine the experiment that should be performed next because one must wait for a sequential execution to be completed before results are obtained.},

abstract = {The simulation speed is a key issue in virtual prototyping of Multi-Processors System on Chip (MPSoCs). The SystemC TLM2.0 (Transaction Level Modeling) approach accelerates the simulation by using Interface Method Calls (IMC) to implement the communications between hardware components. Another source of speedup can be exploited by parallel simulation. Multi-core workstations are becoming the mainstream, and SMP workstations will soon contain several tens of cores. The standard SystemC simulation engine uses a centralized scheduler, that is clearly the bottleneck for a parallel simulation. This paper has two main contributions. The first is a general modeling strategy for shared memory MPSoCs, called TLM-DT (Transaction Level Modeling with Distributed Time). The second is a truly parallel simulation engine, called SystemC-SMP. First experimental results on a 40 processor MPSoC virtual prototype running on a dual-core workstation demonstrate a 1.8 speedup, versus a sequential simulation.},

@article{Hosein2012,
abstract = {Electronic System Level (ESL) design of embedded systems proposes raising the abstraction level of the design entry to cope with the increasing complexity of such systems. To ex- ploit the benefits of ESL, design languages should allowspec- ification of models which are a) heterogeneous, to describe different aspects of systems; b) formally defined, for applica- tion of analysis and synthesis methods; c) executable, to en- able early detection of specification; and d) parallel, to exploit the multi- and many-core platforms for simulation and imple- mentation. We present a modeling library on top of SystemC, targeting heterogeneous embedded system design, based on four models of computation. The library has a formal basis where all elements are well defined and lead in construction of analyzable models. The semantics of communication and computation are implemented by the library, which allows the designer to focus on specifying the pure functional aspects. A key advantage is that the formalism is used to export the structure and behavior of the models via introspection as an abstract representation for further analysis and synthesis.

@book{Fujimoto1999,
abstract = {A state-of-the-art guide for the implementation of distributed simulation technology. The rapid expansion of the Internet and commodity parallel computers has made parallel and distributed simulation (PADS) a hot technology indeed. Applications abound not only in the analysis of complex systems such as transportation or the next-generation Internet, but also in computer-generated virtual worlds for military and professional training, interactive computer games, and the entertainment industry. In this book, PADS expert Richard M. Fujimoto provides software developers with cutting-edge techniques for speeding up the execution of simulations across multiple processors and dealing with data distribution over wide area networks ,including the Internet. With an emphasis on parallel and distributed discrete event simulation technologies, Dr. Fujimoto compiles and consolidates research results in the field spanning the last twenty years, discussing the use of parallel and distributed computers in both the modeling and analysis of system behavior and the creation of distributed virtual environments. While other books on PADS concentrate on applications, Parallel and Distributed Simulation Systems clearly shows how to implement the technology. It explains in detail the synchronization algorithms needed to properly realize the simulations, including an in-depth discussion of time warp and advanced optimistic techniques. Finally, the book is richly supplemented with references, tables and illustrations, and examples of contemporary systems such as the Department of Defense's High Level Architecture (HLA), which has become the standard architecture for defense programs in the United States.},

abstract = {The problem of system simulation is typically solved in a sequential manner due to the wide and intensive sharing of variables by all parts of the system. We propose a distributed solution where processes communicate only through messages with their neighbors; there are no shared variables and there is no central process for message routing or process scheduling. Deadlock is avoided in this system despite the absence of global control. Each process in the solution requires only a limited amount of memory. The correctness of a distributed system is proven by proving the correctness of each of its component processes and then using inductive arguments. The proposed solution has been empirically found to be efficient in preliminary studies. The paper presents formal, detailed proofs of correctness.},

@article{Hakansson2013,
abstract = {Research methods and methodologies are extremely important when conducting research and degree projects. The use and application of the methods and methodologies are considered to be “necessarily vicious” and, unfortunately, often applied after the research has been conducted. The need for applying methods before the actually research and the reasons for doing so are often stressed in the literature and courses for research and scientific writing. This includes the aspects of selecting, understanding and applying research methods for a selected project. Unfortunately, it is difficult to choose well-suited methods and too often the selected methods and methodologies do not match each other. Instead, methods are applied without knowing about the consequences the applied method have both on the other chosen methods and on the results of the work or research. This paper provides a portal of research methods and methodologies to help the students to choose and apply the most suitable methods by illustrating which methods belong together and the distinctions between the different methods.},

@book{Furia2010,
abstract = {The increasing relevance of areas such as real-time and embedded systems, pervasive computing, hybrid systems control, and biological and social systems modeling is bringing a growing attention to the tempo- ral aspects of computing, not only in the computer science domain, but also in more traditional fields of engineering. This article surveys various approaches to the formal modeling and analysis of the temporal features of computer-based systems, with a level of detail that is also suitable for nonspecialists. In doing so, it provides a unifying framework, rather than just a comprehensive list of formalisms. The article first lays out some key dimensions along which the various formalisms can be evaluated and compared. Then, a significant sample of formalisms for time modeling in computing are presented and discussed according to these dimensions. The adopted perspective is, to some extent, historical, going from traditional models and formalisms to more modern ones.},
